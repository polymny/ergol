# Using ergol with rocket

You can integrate ergol with [rocket](https://crates.io/crates/rocket)!

There is a little bit of boilerplate, but once everything is set up, you can use ergol in your
routes!

```rust
# extern crate ergol;
{{#include ../../examples/rocket/src/main.rs}}
```

See [the example](https://github.com/polymny/ergol/blob/dev/example/src/rocket.rs) for more
details.
